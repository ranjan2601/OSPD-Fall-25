# Mail Client Service Client

Auto-generated HTTP client for the Mail Client Service API.

## Overview

This package contains the code generated by `openapi-python-client` from the Mail Client Service OpenAPI specification. It provides a type-safe, low-level HTTP client for communicating with the service.

## Purpose

This is a **pure auto-generated client**. It knows nothing about `mail_client_api` or the domain-specific interfaces. Its only job is to provide a typed HTTP client for making requests to the FastAPI service.

## Generation

This client was generated using:

```bash
openapi-python-client generate --path openapi_schema.json
```

## Dependencies

- `httpx` - HTTP client library
- `attrs` - Python classes without boilerplate
- `python-dateutil` - Date parsing utilities

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Not Recommended)

While you can use this client directly, it's recommended to use the `mail_client_adapter` instead, which wraps this client and implements the `mail_client_api.Client` interface.

```python
from mail_client_service_client import Client

# Create a client
client = Client(base_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Make requests (returns raw response objects)
from mail_client_service_client.mail_client_service_api_client.api.default import (
    get_messages_messages_get,
)

response = get_messages_messages_get.sync(client=client, max_results=10)
```

### Recommended Usage

Use the `mail_client_adapter` package instead:

```python
from mail_client_adapter import ServiceClient

client = ServiceClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
messages = client.get_messages(max_results=10)
```

## Structure

The auto-generated client includes:

- **Client**: Base HTTP client with session management
- **AuthenticatedClient**: Client with authentication support
- **Models**: Pydantic models for request/response data
- **API methods**: Type-safe functions for each endpoint
- **Types**: Custom types and utilities

## Notes

- This is **auto-generated code**. Do not manually edit files in this package.
- To update the client, regenerate it from the updated OpenAPI schema.
- This package is consumed by `mail_client_adapter`, not by end-user code directly.
- Ruff and mypy checks are disabled for this package since it's auto-generated.

## Regenerating

If the FastAPI service API changes:

1. Start the service and export the OpenAPI schema
2. Run `openapi-python-client generate` with the new schema
3. Replace the contents of this package with the newly generated code

## Design Philosophy

This package follows the principle of **separation of concerns**:
- **This package**: Low-level HTTP client (generated)
- **mail_client_adapter**: High-level adapter (hand-written)
- **mail_client_service**: Server implementation (hand-written)

Each has its own dependencies and responsibilities, making the system modular and maintainable.
